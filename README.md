# Characteristic-based-approach-for-extracting-features-from-requirements


Software Product Line (SPL) is a software system with shared architecture and creating
a similar set of systems from a shared set of software assets to satisfy the needs of a
particular market. A SPL is very important to achieve universal business goals. It can
be represented in terms of features, where a feature can be denoted as the characteristic
or behaviour exhibited by a software system. With usage of desired Natural Language
Processing (NLP) techniques automatic extraction of these features can be done which
will help the system produce effective results much faster.


In recent years, with the advances in machine learning interest has been created to apply
them creatively in many fields. Particularly with the emerging of social media, short text
clustering is being shown great importance due to its applications such as identifying
the keywords, summarization, and recommendation. NLP plays a key role in automatic
extraction of these features. The features can be extracted by taking external knowledge
of dierent word embeddings and with the use of short text similarity algorithms, which
are considered as the characteristics. These acquired characteristics are further analysed
using dierent clustering techniques for extracting features that we can use in an SPL.
Based on this research work, the model can be further improved by taking dierent
combinations of characteristics.


The mentioned approach, will provide the multiple dimensional overview by considering
these characteristics in a systematic way. With the help of human decisions at a
few points, these features can be automatically extracted for different use cases. The
implementation is carried out over different datasets and the respective top features are
acquired. This approach will also evaluate how to improve the accuracy of features by
taking different combinations of characteristics.


In the proposed approach, nouns and verbs of the original datasets are considered as a
new dataset. The same procedure is implemented over our new dataset to observe the
performance fluctuations. The observed results for both the datasets are then evaluated.
This parts helps understanding the requirements that carry much-needed information.


The model is implemented on two datasets and the results are recorded to observe the impact of 
characteristics.
